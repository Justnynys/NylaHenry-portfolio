<p> Thank you for taking the time to look over my profile.My name is Nyla A. Williams Henry. At Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical High School, I am a senior. I'd like to gain more computer and coding knowledge. Learning additional programming languages that I do not already know would be helpful. An illustration of a JavaScript script is the one that follows. I want to focus on activities that will help me hone my knowledge of programming languages. One of my brothers and sisters is older than I am, while the other is younger. The news that my older sister is pregnant this year made me very happy because it meant that I will soon become an aunt. I do not live with my parents.Since the age of one, I've lived with my aunt.
